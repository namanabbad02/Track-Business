## 📌 Overview

Track-Business is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to help admin/users efficiently manage their business operations. It provides a suite of tools for tracking clients, projects, finances, invoices, and tasks in a secure, multi-user environment. The application is built with a scalable and modular architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🔐User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with secure password hashing by bcrypt.js.
-   **👥Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated permissions for users (e.g., admin, manager, staff).
-   **📁Modular REST API:** Separate routes, controllers, and models for clients, projects, finances, invoices, and tasks, built using Express.js for scalable endpoint management.
-   **💾Data Persistence with MySQL:** Structured schemas for Users, Clients, Projects, Invoices, and Tasks.
-   **🧾Business Workflow Automation:** Full CRUD operations for tracking invoices, recording payments, managing project statuses, and assigning tasks.
-   **⚠️Error Handling & Validation:** Centralized middleware for error catching, JWT validation, and request input checking using `express-validator`.
-   **🧼Clean Code Organization:** A well-structured codebase with distinct folders for controllers, models, routes, middleware, and configuration.
