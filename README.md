## Overview

Track-Business is a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to help admin/users efficiently manage their business operations. It provides a suite of tools for tracking clients, projects, finances, invoices, and tasks in a secure, multi-user environment. The application is built with a scalable and modular architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Key Features

-   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with secure password hashing by bcrypt.js.
-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiated permissions for users (e.g., admin, manager, staff).
-   **Modular REST API:** Separate routes, controllers, and models for clients, projects, finances, invoices, and tasks, built using Express.js for scalable endpoint management.
-   **Data Persistence with MySQL:** Structured schemas for Users, Clients, Projects, Invoices, and Tasks.
-   **Business Workflow Automation:** Full CRUD operations for tracking invoices, recording payments, managing project statuses, and assigning tasks.
-   **Error Handling & Validation:** Centralized middleware for error catching, JWT validation, and request input checking using `express-validator`.
-   **Clean Code Organization:** A well-structured codebase with distinct folders for controllers, models, routes, middleware, and configuration.

    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_db_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
    DB_NAME=track_business
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the MySQL server.**

2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.




## API Endpoints

The API is organized into the following modules:

-   **Auth:** `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`
-   **Clients:** `/api/clients` (GET, POST), `/api/clients/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
-   **Projects:** `/api/projects` (GET, POST), `/api/projects/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
